# Ghost Team: DND

This is a project I'm making because I am learning to play DND.
I really like it so I wanted to make it into a game
based off of the story me and my brother made.
It uses DND elements, but works differently from it.

## Requirements

### Nerd Font

Nerd Fonts are fonts that have special symbols. You can get them [at their website.](https://www.nerdfonts.com)

If you need to know how to use one, you can find guides online for your
operating system.
