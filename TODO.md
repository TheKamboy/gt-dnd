## Backlog

- Work on the game intro
    > The intro to the game will introduce you to the controls. Inventory needs to be finished first...
    * [ ] Entering Town
    * [ ] Interactable NPCS
    * [ ] Quests before game starts to teach gameplay
    * [ ] Outro to the intro (that name will do)
- More Enemy AI
    > welp i forgot that away only works when setting paths, so i will test it later
    * [ ] Test Away Mode
    * [ ] Make Range Mode
    * [ ] Test Range Mode

## To Do

- Water Mechanics
    > Water has a special path, that if jumped into, you will follow the current. You will not lose any health from it.
    * [ ] Jump over mechanic
    * [ ] Get moved by current
- Lava Mechanics
    > Similar to water, but there is no current, and you take damage.
    * [ ] Add in jump over mechanic from water
    * [ ] Take random burning damage when in it from  failing to jump over, or being in it for one turn

## Doing

- Inventory Menu
    > Allows the user to equip weapons, use items, and of course, view items
    * [ ] Display Menu Items
    * [ ] Switch Equiped Weapon once per turn
    * [ ] Healing Items
    * [ ] Other Key Items

## Done

- Fix Game Options Bug
    > It's  not really a bug, but it's an oversight. I have to code in every new status to an option (ex. movement) so that it doesn't open it.
- Other Mechanics
    > Other features that are important, but don't need a special task
    * [x] Move freely if out of combat
    * [x] Nicer Looking Menus with drawBox()
    * [x] Screen Size Detector
